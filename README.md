# Multi_processes-MergeSort
C/C++

Overview
Sorting is an important concept in programming. There are multiple algorithms to perform such operations such as BubbleSort, QuickSort, RadixSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, etc.

Instructions
Write a C/C++ program under Linux/MacOS which reads its input from a plain text file (containing positive integer numbers separated by one or multiple separator characters). The input filename and the separator character should be provided as command like argument. The software should read the numbers from the file and sort them.
The sorting should use the concept of divide and impera and processes (see fork() ).
